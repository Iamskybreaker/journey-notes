# ⚔️ Skybreaker™ Day 8 — August 19, 2025

### Theme: Storage Deep Dive & CPU Memory Interaction
**Study Time:** ~1hr  
**Notes:** ~3 pages

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Explored the **full storage hierarchy** from yesterday in detail: Registers → Cache → RAM/ROM → SSD → HDD → Optical → Magnetic Tape  
- Registers: smallest, fastest, store only bits; Cache: slightly larger, still very fast; RAM/ROM: main memory for active instructions/data  
- Secondary storage varies in speed, cost, and access method: HDD = magnetic disks, SSD = electronic, Optical = laser reads, Tape = slowest & cheapest  
- **Key insight:** Cache boosts CPU speed, RAM holds active instructions, secondary storage too slow for direct CPU access
- Also interesting fact; disks (with k) is used for storage related to magnetism and discs (with c), for those related to optics (light/laser)

## 🎯 What’s Next (Day 9 Goals)

- Dive deeper into **CPU ↔ memory flow & optimization**  
- Compare **HDD vs SSD performance** in practice  
- Begin **OS fundamentals**: see how storage interacts with system calls and processes

## 🔍 Reflection

Today was a good opportunity for **clarity and depth**.  
Understanding how storage layers interact with CPU operations gives a solid foundation for tackling OS and performance topics next.  

Feeling locked in, consistent, and grateful for each step of growth. Heaven Yeah ⚔️💻🙏🏾
