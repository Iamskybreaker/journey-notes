📚 Focus: Storage structure & hierarchy
⏱️ Study Duration: ~45 mins  
📝 Notes: 2 pages

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Took a look on the storage devices we have and their hierarchy
- The hierarchy: registers - cache - main memory - electronic disk - magnetic disk - optical disk - magnetic tapes
- Registers are the fastest and most reliable of all storage but also the most expensive  
- Going up the hierachy devices are faster, more expensive and have smaller capacity and vice versa for going down the hierarchy

## 🎯 What’s Next (Day 8 Goals)

- Still going to look more into Storage and its relationship before transitioning to Operating system as planned earlier; Primarily:
  ▫️ How cache, ram and storage flow 
  ▫️ RAM and ROM
  ▫️ HDD vs SSD

## 🔍 Reflection

Day 8 was not the longest but it was an impactful day.
It felt great finally being able to study personally and work on my cybersecurity knowledge after the huge gap from prepping and writing exams;
Hopefully each day of studying feels just as good and impactful and I can learn to stay more consistent through God's grace
