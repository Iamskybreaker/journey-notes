### Theme: Networking Basics – Static vs Dynamic IPs  
**Study Time:** ~30 mins  
**Notes:** ~1 page

## 🧠 What I Learned

- **Static IPs:**  
  • Remain fixed and don’t change  
  • Used for servers, hosting, and devices that must always be reachable  

- **Dynamic IPs:**  
  • Assigned automatically by DHCP  
  • Change periodically, more efficient and secure for regular users  

- **Key Difference:**  
  • Static = reliability  
  • Dynamic = flexibility
