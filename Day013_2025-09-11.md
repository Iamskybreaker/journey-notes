# ⚔️ Skybreaker™ Day 13 — September 11, 2025

### Theme: Networking Basics – IP Addresses (Continued)
**Study Time:** ~1hr 30mins  
**Notes:** ~3 pages  

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- **IPv6 Structure:**  
  • 128-bit addresses allowing virtually unlimited unique IPs  
  • Formatted in eight groups of four hexadecimal digits  

- **Public vs Private IPs:**  
  • Public IPs: Routable on the internet  
  • Private IPs: Used within local networks, not directly accessible from the internet  

- **Network Address Translation (NAT):**  
  • Allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP  
  • Key for overcoming IPv4 limitations

## 🎯 What’s Next (Day 14 Goals)

- Complete any leftover IP address concepts  
- Begin learning **LAN vs WAN**, packets, switches, routers, and basic network flow

## 🔍 Reflection

Today was all about deepening my understanding of IPs and how devices identify themselves on networks.  
NAT was a bit tricky at first, but breaking it down helped it click. Excited to continue networking next session.
