# ⚔️ Skybreaker™ Day 10 — August 28, 2025

### Theme: OS & Memory Flow Recap
**Study Time:** ~1hr  
**Notes:** ~3 pages  

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- **OS as Traffic Controller:**  
  • Loads programs from disk → RAM → CPU  
  • Handles memory protection, virtual memory, and swapping  

- **Memory Hierarchy in Action:**  
  • Disk (slow) → RAM → Cache → Registers → ALU (fastest)  
  • Cache reduces wait times; OS manages flow; CPU executes  

- **Analogy:**  
  • Disk = archive server  
  • RAM = active workspace  
  • Registers = hotkeys  
  • ALU = processor  
  • Cache = sticky notes  
  • OS = lab manager  

- **Key Idea:** OS keeps the system running smoothly, ensuring your programs get the right memory at the right time

## 🔍 Reflection
So the weekend is here and yes I know it's not like i was ever-present this week lol, but there will be no sessions this weekend, rather i'll be using that time to revise and polish what i've learnt so far.
Also wanted to clarify that I'll probably be moving to another aspect of my studying by Monday; We've been exploring the relationship between CPU and Storage for a while now but I think I'm ready for something new

Another study session completed = Another thank you God. Heaven Yeah ⚔️💻
