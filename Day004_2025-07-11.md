# ⚔️ Skybreaker™ Day 4 — July 11, 2025  
### Theme: How the CPU Talks to Memory and Knows What to Do  
**Study Time:** ~40 minutes  
**Notes:** 2 full pages

## 🧠 What I Learned:

### 🔹 1. Memory Is Addressed, Not Random  
- Every instruction or piece of data in memory has a specific **address**.  
- The CPU doesn’t "search" — it’s told exactly where to look.  

### 🔹 2. Registers = Command Crew  
- **IP (Instruction Pointer):** Points to next instruction  
- **MAR (Memory Address Register):** Holds address to access  
- **MDR (Memory Data Register):** Carries data to/from memory  
- **IR (Instruction Register):** Holds current instruction  
- **General-purpose registers (R1, R2, etc.):** Used for calculations and logic  

### 🔹 3. Registers Don’t Hunt — They Hold  
- They move values, not search for them  
- Their roles are specific and signal-driven  

### 🔹 4. Control Unit = Traffic Controller  
- Manages flow of operations  
- Sends control signals to guide each step of the fetch-decode-execute cycle  

### 🔹 5. Separation of Duties  
- **Special-purpose registers:** Run the internal machine logic  
- **General-purpose registers:** Execute your program logic

## 🔁 Reflection:
Didn’t go too deep today — but saw the **structure** of how a CPU really functions.  
The system works because it’s organized — and now, I’m starting to think like it.  

One step closer to understanding the machine I’ll one day secure, manipulate, or even control.
