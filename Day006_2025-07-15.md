# ⚔️ Skybreaker™ Day 6 — July 15, 2025

📚 Focus: CPU Revision & Clarification  
⏱️ Study Duration: ~2 hours  
📝 Notes: 1 page (revision outlines)

---

## 🔁 What I Focused On

- Reviewed and finalized understanding on the instruction fetch cycle & control signals  
- Refined my understanding of how the ALU, IP, MAR, MDR, and IR interact  
- Took a quiz to test concept retention  
- Marked areas that need deeper review tomorrow

## 🧠 Key Realization

The **ALU doesn’t access RAM.**  
It performs operations *only* on data that’s already stored inside CPU **registers**.  
This keeps processing fast and internal, with no memory-fetch delay.

Understanding that was a game-changer.

## 🎯 What’s Next ?
From Tomorrow:
- Begin studying **Storage**:  
  ▫️ Understand HDD vs SSD  
  ▫️ How data is stored, accessed, and transferred  
  ▫️ Learn about volatility and performance impact

- Explore the **Operating System (OS)**:  
  ▫️ What it is and how it manages memory, programs, and devices  
  ▫️ OS roles in relation to CPU and storage  
  ▫️ Processes, scheduling, and system calls

## 💬 Final Note

Day 6 wasn’t about racing ahead — it was about locking down the basics and correcting gaps.  
These days are just as vital.  

Still building. Still Skybreaker.  
Heaven Yeah. ⚔️
