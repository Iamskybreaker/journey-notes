## 🧠 What I Learned

### ✅ The Instruction Fetch Cycle:
1. **Instruction Pointer (IP):**  
   Holds the address of the next instruction

2. **Memory Address Register (MAR):**  
   Receives the address from IP

3. **Address Bus:**  
   Carries the address to main memory

4. **Memory:**  
   Sends the instruction (e.g., LOAD A) via Data Bus

5. **Instruction Register (IR):**  
   Receives and stores the fetched instruction

6. **Instruction Pointer Update:**  
   IP increments to point to the next instruction

💡 This loop happens continuously — it's the "thinking loop" of your CPU.
