# ⚔️ Skybreaker™ Day 5 — July 14, 2025

🧠 Theme: Clarity Over Complexity   
⏱ Study Duration: ~30 mins  
📓 Notes: 1 full page + refinements from past sessions

---

## 🔍 What I Did Today

- Revisited the CPU instruction fetch cycle with a sharper lens
- Refined my mental model of how the IP, ALU, and control unit work
- Flagged misleading oversimplifications in my earlier notes:
  - “IP is connected to the bus” isn’t fully accurate
  - ALU isn’t just for complex math — sometimes it's just incrementing IP
- Rewrote parts of my notes to reflect deeper understanding
- Identified unclear zones to target in tomorrow’s session

---

## 💡 Key Realizations

- The **IP (Instruction Pointer)** doesn’t just hold an address — it *steps forward* after every instruction
- The **ALU** isn’t always “crunching numbers” — often it’s just adding `+1` to move the IP along
- A lot of beginner resources oversimplify how control and memory interactions work — and I’m starting to see through that now

---

## 📌 Overall Takeaway

Not every session needs to be about speed or quantity.  
**Today was a depth day.**  
Even though I didn’t fly through new topics, I cleaned up foundational misunderstandings and leveled up mentally.
