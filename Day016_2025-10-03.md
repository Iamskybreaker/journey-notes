# ⚔️ Skybreaker™ Day 16 — October 3, 2025

### Theme: Data Packets & Packet Switching
**Study Time:** ~30 mins  
**Notes:** ~1+ page(s)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- **Data Packets:** Small chunks of data that the internet breaks information into for transfer, then reassembled at the destination.
- **Why Packets:** Sending data in one piece (circuit switching) can halt other transmissions; packet switching allows multiple devices to send data simultaneously.
- **Packet Independence:** Packets can arrive out of order; each has a **sequence number** to reassemble correctly.
- **Structure of a Packet:**
  • **Header:** Source IP, Destination IP, Port, Sequence Number  
  • **Payload:** Actual data being transmitted  
  • **Trailer:** Signals end of transmission & error checking

## 🎯 What’s Next (Day 17 Goals)

- Continue exploring **packet flow**  
- Study **switches, routers**, and how packets move across LANs and WANs

## 🔍 Reflection

Understanding packet switching makes the internet’s efficiency make sense — multiple streams of data can flow simultaneously without blocking each other. Today clarified a crucial concept in networking.
