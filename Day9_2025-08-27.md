# ⚔️ Skybreaker™ Day 9 — August 27, 2025

### Theme: Storage & CPU Flow Recap
**Study Time:** ~30mins  
**Notes:** ~1+ page

## 🧠 What I Learned

Using a video game as a sample for flow:
- **Secondary Storage (SSD/HDD):** where programs and games live initially  
- **RAM (Main Memory):** loads executable instructions, textures, and logic for quick access  
- **CPU Registers:** hold temporary values like scores, lives, or variables during gameplay  
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):** performs all calculations (points, kills, or game logic)  

- **Flow Example:**  
  • Double-click game → instruction lives on SSD → RAM loads textures & logic → registers store temporary game values → ALU calculates → results go back to RAM, storage, or output (screen/audio)  

- **Key Takeaways:**  
  • CPU never works alone; it always interacts with memory & registers  
  • ALU only handles computation, registers handle temporary data, RAM handles active program data, storage holds everything permanently  
  • Output can be stored back or displayed via Screen, GPU, speakers

## 🎯 What’s Next (Day 10 Goals)
- Take a look into **CPU ↔ memory optimization**  
- Diving more into **Cache** and how it assists the CPU
- Begin some **OS fundamentals**: see how storage interacts with system calls and processes

## 🔍 Reflection

Today was a strong clarity session.  
Seeing how each layer interacts solidifies understanding for OS and performance topics ahead.  

It was a brief yet strong bounce back session, I'd also like to apologize for the pause in my studying and my updates but I'm back for good this time.
Once again feeling grateful to God for each step 💻🙏🏾
