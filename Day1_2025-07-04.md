# Day 1 – Foundations of How a Computer Works

🧠 **What I Studied:**
- The computer has three major internal units:
  • **Computing Unit** – performs calculations  
  • **Memory Unit** – stores data and results  
  • **Control Unit** – directs how data flows and operations are carried out

- These units talk to each other through the **bus**, which transfers:
  • Data  
  • Addresses  
  • Control signals

- Programs are stored in main memory.
  • Instructions are fetched into the **Instruction Register (IR)**
  • The **Control Unit** decodes and executes them
  • The **Program Counter (PC)** keeps track of which instruction comes next
