# ⚔️ Skybreaker™ Day 15 — October 2, 2025

### Theme: Networking Basics — LAN vs WAN
**Study Time:** ~30 mins  
**Notes:** ~1+ page(s)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- **LAN (Local Area Network):**  
  • Covers a small area (home, office, building)  
  • Connects computers, TVs, printers, CCTV, etc.  
  • Router = host, assigns private IPs  
  • High speed, low latency, privately owned  
  • Uses Wi-Fi & Ethernet  

- **WAN (Wide Area Network):**  
  • Connects multiple LANs over large geographical areas (states, countries, continents)  
  • Devices require public IPs to communicate  
  • Slower speed, higher latency than LAN  
  • Can be private or ISP-managed  
  • Uses fiber, satellites, and cellular networks  

- **Key Idea:** Network scale affects speed, latency, and type of IP addressing; understanding LAN vs WAN lays the foundation for packet flow, routing, and global connectivity

## 🎯 What’s Next (Day 16 Goals)

- Explore **packets, switches, and routers**  
- Understand **basic network flow** between LANs and WANs

## 🔍 Reflection

Today’s session clarified the difference between small, fast, private networks and wide-reaching networks like the Internet.  
Seeing the contrast helps me visualize how devices communicate locally versus globally.  

Another step forward = another step in clarity and growth. ⚡💻
