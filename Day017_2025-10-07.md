**Study Time:** ~40 mins  
**Notes:** ~2 pages

## 🧠 What I Learned

- **Hub:**  
  • Connects multiple devices in a network but broadcasts data to *all* connected devices.  
  • Not intelligent — doesn’t filter or direct traffic.

- **Switch:**  
  • Similar to a hub but *smarter*.  
  • Uses **MAC addresses** to send data only to the correct device within a LAN.  
  • Improves speed, reduces traffic congestion, and increases efficiency.

- **Router:**  
  • Connects *multiple networks* together (e.g., LAN to WAN).  
  • Uses **IP addresses** to forward data to the correct destination network.  
  • Makes routing decisions based on routing tables.  
  • Essentially the “bridge” between internal and external networks.

## 🎯 What’s Next (Day 18 Goals)

- Study **Default Gateways**, **Routing Tables**, and **Static vs Dynamic Routing**.  
- Understand how routers decide the best path for data to travel.

## 🔍 Reflection

Today brought a little clarification to the network flow - I now understand the role each device plays in moving data efficiently across networks.  
It’s like watching the digital ecosystem come alive piece by piece.
