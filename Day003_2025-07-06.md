## 🧠 What I Learned:

- What it means for instructions to be “automatically pre-stored” in memory  
- Programs are written by developers and stored in files  
- CPU doesn’t fetch source code — it runs compiled or interpreted instructions  
- Compilers, interpreters, and operating systems are all part of the execution flow  
- The goal of all this? To let humans control raw machine power

## 🔍 Realization of the Day:

Every app we run is someone else’s logic, translated into machine language.  
One day, that “someone” won’t just be me — I’ll be testing, breaking, and securing that logic.
